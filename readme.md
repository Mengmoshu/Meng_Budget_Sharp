# Meng Budget Sharp

This is a C# and WPF based budget tracking tool. I don't expect it to be particularly useful to anybody else, but I need a budget, and I need excuses to practice programming. The hope is that by the time this project starts being *useful* I'll have learned a decent amount about building GUIs in WPF, reading and writing JSON, and possibly in the future using SQLite from C#.
